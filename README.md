# Extended_Kalman_Filter

This project implements an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** to estimate the states (position, velocity, and acceleration) of a falling object in the presence of drag. The object's motion is modeled in polar coordinates, and the EKF is used to fuse noisy measurements of range and angle to improve state estimation.
